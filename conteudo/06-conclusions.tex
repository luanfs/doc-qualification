\chapter{Future work}
\label{chp-conclusions}
Since the advection finite volume on the cubed-sphere has been already implemented,
we are currently investigating the interpolation/reconstruction of the scalar field
at the cube edges aiming to reduce the numerical noises that we observed in some advection
test cases.

We also aim to study and implement the shallow-water finite volume model
on the sphere introduced by \citet{lin:1997} and extend it to cubed-sphere following \cite{putman:2007}.
We also shall investigate some modifications on the cubed-sphere
such as the equal-edge cubed-sphere proposed by \cite{chen:2021} and the
cubed-sphere with panels overlapping.

Regarding scientific conferences, we intend to attend the PDEs on the sphere 2023 conference
(last edition webpage: \url{https://www.dwd.de/EN/specialusers/research_education/seminar/2021/pdes_on_the_sphere/pdes_2020_en_node.html}), which will take place in France around July 2023.
We aim to present some of the results obtained in this research.

We intend to do a two weeks scientific visit to the researcher Ra≈Ñcic from NOAA 
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), with whom we expect to do a collaborative
work on cubed-sphere finite volume schemes.
