\chapter{Code avaibility}
\label{anexo-code}

The codes needed for this work have been built openly at GitHub. 
The PPM implementation for the one-dimensional advection equation used in Chapter 
\ref{chp-1d-fv} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/py-ppm}.
The dimension-splitting implementation for the advection equation on the plane used in 
Chapter \ref{chp-2d-fv} is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/py-dimension-splitting}.
At last, all the grid tools for the cubed sphere used Chapters \ref{chp-cs-grids} and \ref{chp-cs-fv},
including the finite volume model on this grid, is available in a Python version 
at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/py-cubed-sphere} and in a Fortran 90 version at
\url{https://github.com/luanfs/cubed-sphere}.
