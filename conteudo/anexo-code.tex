\chapter{Code avaibility}
\label{anexo-sph}

The codes needed for this work have been built openly at GitHub. 
The PPM implementation for the one-dimensional advection equation is available 
at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/py-ppm}.
The dimension-splitting implementation for the advection equation on the plane 
is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/py-dimension-splitting}.
At last, all the grid tools for the cubed sphere, including the finite volume
model on this grid, is available at \url{https://github.com/luanfs/py-cubed-sphere}.

The implementation of the high-order schemes for the moist shallow-water model
on Voronoi grids may be accessed at
\url{https://github.com/pedrospeixoto/iModel}.

Finally, the report for the qualification exam has also been built at  GitHub in the following  repository:
\url{https://github.com/luanfs/doc-qualification}.

All the contents in GithHub's repositories shown previously are under constant development.
