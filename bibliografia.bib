%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INSERINDO COMENTÁRIOS EM ARQUIVOS .bib %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% 1. Como em outros arquivos LaTeX, comentários são iniciados por "%" e,
%    portanto, é preciso usar "\%" para imprimir o caractere "%". Esquecer
%    disso pode gerar erros difíceis de encontrar!
%
% 2. Não é possível inserir comentários dentro de uma entrada, apenas fora.
%
% 3. Não é possível incluir o caractere arroba em um comentário.
%
% 4. Se quiser desabilitar temporariamente um campo ("comentar" o campo),
%    troque seu nome para algum nome inválido, como "author-disable".
%    Se quiser fazer alguma observação permanente dentro de uma entrada,
%    você também pode usar algum nome de campo inválido, como "lembrete",
%    ou usar o campo "annotation", que normalmente é ignorado.
%
% 5. Se quiser desabilitar temporariamente uma entrada inteira ("comentar" a
%    entrada), não basta colocar "%" nas linhas correspondentes por causa do
%    caractere arroba; também é preciso remover a arroba.
%
% 6. Na verdade, as regras não são bem essas, mas segui-las é uma boa ideia:
%    https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/262282
%
% Por exemplo, esta entrada está comentada, ou seja, não tem efeito: se
% houvesse uma referência a ela no texto, a referência ficaria inválida.
% Observe que, para isso, o caractere arroba foi apagado!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% O CAMPO "MONTH" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% biblatex prefere o uso do campo "date" para definir ano, mês etc. No
% entanto, se você quiser garantir compatibilidade tanto com biblatex
% quanto com bibtex, use os campos "year" e "month". Ambos reconhecem
% diversos formatos para o campo "month", mas apenas um funciona
% corretamente com os dois: o nome do mês em inglês, abreviado com três
% letras minúsculas e sem chaves, ou seja:
%

% year = {2011},
% month = oct,

abstract = {A class of new benchmark deformational flow test cases for the two-dimensional horizontal linear transport problems on the sphere is proposed. The scalar field follows complex trajectories and undergoes severe deformation during the simulation; however, the flow reverses its course at half-time and the scalar field returns to its initial position and shape. This process makes the exact solution available at the end of the simulation, and facilitates assessment of the accuracy of the underlying transport scheme. A procedure to eliminate possible cancellations of errors when the flow reverses is proposed. The test suite consists of four cases. Three are based on non-divergent flow fields and one on a divergent flow. The initial conditions are prescribed in terms of regular latitude–longitude spherical coordinates and are easy to implement. The divergent flow is specifically aimed for conservative global transport schemes to test for conservation, consistency and monotonicity (or positivity) of limiters/filters in a challenging flow environment. In the context of semi-Lagrangian schemes, the time-varying flow fields can be used to test trajectory algorithms where the exact trajectories do not follow great-circle arcs. The characteristics of the test cases are demonstrated with two different transport schemes.}

abstract = {Abstract The rapidly increasing computing powers allow global atmospheric simulations with aggressively high resolutions, challenging traditional model design principles. This study presents a Low Mach number Approximate Riemann Solver (LMARS) based unstaggered finite-volume model for solving the shallow-water equations on arbitrary gnomonic cubed-sphere grids. Using a novel reference line-based grid-generation process, it unifies the representation of arbitrary gnomonic cubed-sphere grid projections and permits high-efficiency 1D reconstruction in the halo regions. The numerical discretization also extends a widely used pressure gradient algorithm with the LMARS viscous term, thus improves the model's stability for various numerical applications. The solver demonstrates a broad range of organic diffusion control without any explicit filters, validated by a comprehensive set of test cases. Lastly, a newly introduced splash on the sphere test verifies the solver's desirable dispersion properties and consistent performance among different grid types. This study paves a solid foundation for a new generation of global circulation models with kilometer horizontal scales.},

abstract = {A central-upwind finite-volume (CUFV) scheme for shallow-water model on a nonorthogonal equiangular cubed-sphere grid is developed, consequently extending the 1D reconstruction CUFV transport scheme developed by us. High-order spatial discretization based on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) is considered for this effort. The CUFV method combines the alluring features of classical upwind and central schemes. This approach is particularly useful for complex computational domain such as the cubed-sphere. The continuous flux-form spherical shallow water equations in nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinates are utilized. Fluxes along the element boundaries are approximated by a Kurganov–Noelle–Petrova scheme. A fourth-order strong stability preserving Runge–Kutta time stepping scheme for time integration is employed in the present work. The numerical scheme is evaluated with standard shallow water test suite, which accentuate accuracy and conservation properties. In addition, an efficient yet inexpensive bound preserving filter with an optional positivity filter is used to remove spurious oscillations and to achieve strictly positive definite numerical solution. To tackle the discontinuities that arise at the edges of the cubed-sphere grid, we utilize a high-order 1D interpolation procedure combining cubic and quadratic interpolations.The results with the high-order scheme is compared with the results for the same tests for various schemes available in literature. Since, the scheme presented here uses local-cell information, it is expected to be scalable to high number of processors count in a distributed node high-performance computer.}

ABSTRACT = {The transport process is an important part of the research of fluid dynamics, especially when it comes to tracer advection in the atmosphere or ocean dynamics. In this paper, a series of high-order semi-Lagrangian methods for the transport process on the sphere are considered. The methods are formulated entirely in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, thus avoiding any apparent artificial singularities associated with surface-based coordinate systems. The underlying idea of the semi-Lagrangian method is to find the value of the field/tracer at the departure point through interpolating the values of its surrounding grid points to the departure point. The implementation of the semi-Lagrangian method is divided into the following two main procedures: finding the departure point by integrating the characteristic equation backward and then interpolate on the departure point. In the first procedure, three methods are utilized to solve the characteristic equation for the locations of departure points, including the commonly used midpoint-rule method and two explicit high-order Runge&ndash;Kutta (RK) methods. In the second one, for interpolation, four new methods are presented, including (1) linear interpolation; (2) polynomial fitting based on the least square method; (3) global radial basis function stencils (RBFs), and (4) local RBFs. For the latter two interpolation methods, we find that it is crucial to select an optimal value for the shape parameter of the basis function. A Gauss hill advection case is used to compare and contrast the methods in terms of their accuracy, and conservation properties. In addition, the proposed method is applied to standard test cases, which include solid body rotation, shear deformation of twin slotted cylinders, and the evolution of a moving vortex. It demonstrates that the proposed method could simulate all test cases with reasonable accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Dimensionally split advection schemes are attractive for atmospheric modelling due to their efficiency and accuracy in each spatial dimension. Accurate long time steps can be achieved without significant cost using the flux-form semi-Lagrangian technique. The dimensionally split scheme used in this paper is constructed from the one-dimensional Piecewise Parabolic Method and extended to two dimensions using COSMIC splitting. The dimensionally split scheme is compared with a genuinely multi-dimensional, method-of-lines scheme which, with implicit time-stepping, is stable for Courant numbers significantly larger than 1. Two-dimensional advection test cases on Cartesian planes are proposed which avoid the complexities of a spherical domain or multi-panel meshes. These are solid-body rotation, horizontal advection over orography and deformational flow. The test cases use distorted non-orthogonal meshes either to represent sloping terrain or to mimic the distortions near cubed-sphere edges. Mesh distortions are expected to accentuate the errors associated with dimension splitting, however the accuracy of the dimensionally split scheme decreases only a little in the presence of mesh distortions. The dimensionally split scheme also loses some accuracy when long time steps are used. The multi-dimensional scheme is almost entirely insensitive to mesh distortions and asymptotes to second-order accuracy at high resolution. As is expected for implicit time-stepping, phase errors occur when using long time steps but the spatially well-resolved features are advected at the correct speed and the multi-dimensional scheme is always stable. A naive estimate of computational cost (number of multiplies) reveals that the implicit scheme is the most expensive, particularly for large Courant numbers. If the multi-dimensional scheme is used instead with explicit time-stepping, the Courant number is restricted to less than 1, the accuracy is maintained, and the cost becomes similar to the dimensionally split scheme.},
